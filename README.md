# T.E.PWA
Text editor but its just another one. It is a text editor with javascript syntax highlighting.

## Challenges

A big challenge in this assignment was the sticky bugs that would not go away with a page rebuild. Another challenge was trying to overcome the intimidation of a whole new concept and tool for a kit that does so much.

## Purpose

The purpose of this was to solidify more and get more of a grasp of PWA's. By writing out the parts necessary for a PWA to work one can get a better idea of how things work.
